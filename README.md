# Electronic projects

> WARNING! I'm very new to this.

A collection of electronics based projects. This repo is a collection of the notes and code I've generated.

In the main, if I'm connecting to something it'll be a Raspberry Pi using Python for the coding. Else I'm shoving a 9v battery on a breadboard and hoping for the best!

## Projects

- [Raspberry Pi and a button](/projects/rpi_button/README.md)
- [Raspberry Pi and an LED](/projects/rpi_led/README.md)
- [Raspberry Pi and a 7 segment display](/projects/rpi_seven_segment/README.md)

## .fzz files?

These are generated by the [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/home/) app which I use to create images of the circuits I've built (where possible). I find the images are a helpful reminder and guide, and storing the `.fzz` files allows me to make corrections or changes in the future.
